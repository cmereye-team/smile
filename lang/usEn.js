        content: `Many people think that zero myopia or astigmatism will be achieved after vision correction, or the vision will be even clearer vision than wearing glasses or contact lenses, but this is a wrong concept.<br />
        Successful criteria for vision correction: If the outcome is within +/- 75 degrees of the target, this is a successful outcome. When the refraction is less than +/- 75 degrees, the vision is usually within the normal range.<br />
        According to evidence, a refraction of +/- 100 degrees at 3 months after surgery is seen in nearly 100%; if over +/- 100 degrees is noted after surgery, enhancement treatment would be an option.<br />`
      },
      problem2: {
        title: 'Any fluctuation after SMILE?',
        content: `Ophthalmologists suggest that it’s better to undergo SMILE with at least 6 months of stable refraction. Generally, a smaller incision is made during SMILE, and the structure of the cornea remains more stable with lower chances of fluctuation postoperatively. Please consult your ophthalmologist as early as possible if you have a sudden visual change that might be caused by other issues.`
      },
      problem3: {
        title: 'If I am a good candidate for SMILE, can I get the correction done immediately?',
        content: `Our clinic suggests that since we need at least 2 days to conduct comprehensive eye examinations so that we can obtain correct data and design a personalized vision correction plan for you, please make your appointment early.
        Please stop wearing contact lenses before eye checkup:<br />
          Soft contact lenses (excluding astigmatism): Stop wearing them for at least one week<br />
            Soft contact lenses (including astigmatism): Stop wearing them for at least two weeks<br />
            Rigid contact lenses: Stop wearing them for at least one month<br />
            Ortho-K lenses: Stop wearing them for at least three months<br />

      },
      problem4: {
        title: 'What are the differences between SMILE and LASIK?',
        content: `SMILE is an advanced laser correction technology that improves the limitations of LASIK. For example, LASIK requires the creation of a corneal flap, so the incision is larger than SMILE. SMILE only has a small incision of 2-4mm, without creating a corneal flap, so the incision area is reduced by nearly 80% as compared to LASIK. Therefore, it lowers the chances of getting dry eye, infection, and corneal flap displacement. At the same time, recovery time is shortened.`

      problem5: {
        title: 'Will it be painful during the SMILE surgery?',
        content: `Anesthetic eye drops are placed into your eye to numb the eyeball, so there is usually no pain experienced during the procedure. The surgery in both eyes is usually completed in less than 15 minutes.`
      },
      problem6: {
        title: 'How long does SMILE take?',

        title: 'Compared to LASIK, SMILE is a relatively new technology. What is the clinical evidence on SMILE?',
        content: `More than 2 million successful SMILE surgeries have been done worldwide. It is an advanced technology from Zeiss in Germany. It was approved by the European Union in 2011 and approved by the US FDA in 2016. The clinical results of the FDA data found that SMILE is safe, stable, and highly effective. Meanwhile, 88% of guests had unaided eyesight above 1.0 at 6 months after surgery.`

It is suitable for patients: whose cornea is too thin, who have severe myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism, or who are suspected of being at risk of keratoconus. Your surgeon will evaluate your conditions and decide if you need Xtra cross-linking surgery together with your vision correction surgery or not. Usually, riboflavin eye drops will be applied to your eyes and your eyes will be exposed to UVA light to strengthen your cornea. Cross-linking surgery can be simultaneously completed with SMILE.`

For squint patients over 18 years old, please consult your ophthalmologist before any surgical plan. For patients with accommodative squint, it’s an option to get vision correction surgery first and then get your squint corrected later if you do not want to wear glasses. For patients with other types of squint, since the squint itself might have already impacted your quality of life and getting vision correction surgery will not benefit your squint situation, therefore we don’t recommend you to have vision correction.`

It is suitable for patients: whose cornea is too thin, who have severe myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism, or who are suspected of being at risk of keratoconus. Your surgeon will evaluate your conditions and decide if you need Xtra cross-linking surgery together with your vision correction surgery or not. Usually, riboflavin eye drops will be applied to your eyes and your eyes will be exposed to UVA light to strengthen your cornea. Cross-linking surgery can be simultaneously completed with LASIK.`

The surgery process does not require corneal cutting. Instead, the ICL lens is implanted into the eye to achieve better vision. Using non-laser technology, the implantable contact lens corrects high myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism with innovative technology and biocompatible, flexible, and UV-protective crystal materials.The correction process for implantable contact lenses involves a preoperative examination. The doctor first applies anesthetic eye drops to the patient's eye and then creates a small incision of about 3 millimeters in the cornea. The folded lens is then implanted into the eyeball and positioned by the doctor, similar to wearing contact lenses directly on the eye, to achieve the desired vision correction effect. The entire procedure generally takes about 5 to 10 minutes, and there is no need for stitches after surgery. Generally, vision can be restored as early as the next day after correction.`
